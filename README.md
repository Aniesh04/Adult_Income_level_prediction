# Adult_Income_level_prediction
Built a optimized machine learning model after testing with different models with ML Algorithms to predict income levels of individuals based on various demographic factors using Python and Scikit learn

# Description
Many binary classification tasks do not have an equal number of examples from each class, e.g. the class distribution is skewed or imbalanced. A popular example is the adult income dataset that involves predicting personal income levels as above or below $50,000 per year based on personal details such as relationship and education level. There are many more cases of incomes less than $50K than above $50K, although the skew is not severe. This means that techniques for imbalanced classification can be used whilst model performance can still be reported using classification accuracy, as is used with balanced classification problems.
In this project, I developed and evaluated a model for the imbalanced adult income classification dataset.
